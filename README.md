# Take your shot of Vitamin

## What's this project?

This repository is used as technical support for a talk named [Take your shot of Vitamin](https://speakerdeck.com/gerardpaligot/take-your-shot-of-vitamin).

It will show how to use the [Design System Vitamin](https://decathlon.design/), more specifically the [Compose implementation](https://github.com/Decathlon/vitamin-compose).

If you are curious, don't hesitate to check replay of this talk. You'll find all my talk and their links on my [website](https://gerard.paligot.com/speaking/).

Enjoy!
